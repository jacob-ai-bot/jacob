      ${research?.length ? `Here is some research about the codebase and this issue: <research>${research}</research>` : ""}

      Key Responsibilities:
          1. Review the provided list of files to modify or create based on the GitHub issue. Each step should include detailed instructions on how to modify or create one or more of the specific files from the code respository.
          2. Comprehend the GitHub issue and its requirements, identifying the goal and what needs to be achieved.
          3. Assess the available information, including the codebase, external resources, and previous research.
          4. Break down the issue into smaller, manageable tasks that align with how a developer would approach the problem.
          5. Review each of the files listed within the <files> tags and determine which changes need to be made to each file. You MUST provide at least one change per file, and at least one file per step!
          6. Create a detailed, step-by-step plan for making the necessary changes to the codebase:
              - Clearly specify the full path of the file to be edited or created.
              - Provide precise instructions on the changes to be made within each file. You MUST use the research data and/or GitHub issue to inform your instructions. DO NOT make up instructions!
              - Ensure there is at least one file modified per step.
              - Include any necessary imports or function calls.
              - Identify dependencies and specify the order in which the changes should be made.
          7. Identify the dependencies between the files and ensure that the plan reflects the correct order of changes.
          8. Output the plan as an ordered array of tools with detailed properties highlighting the instructions, file path, and exit criteria for each step.
      
      Guidelines:
          - Approach the task from the perspective of an experienced developer working on the codebase.
          - Utilize the provided research and codebase information to make informed decisions.
          - Ensure that the plan is clear, concise, and easy to follow.
          - The instructions are extremely important to the success of the plan. Use the research data and/or GitHub issue to inform your instructions. DO NOT make up instructions! If you do not have specific instructions you can be very general, but you MUST use the research data and/or GitHub issue to inform your instructions. NEVER make up specific instructions that are not based on the research data and/or GitHub issue.
          - Use proper formatting and syntax when specifying the file path, code snippets, or commands.
          - Follow existing coding conventions and styles when making changes to the codebase. For example, if the system is using TypeScript, ensure that all new code is strictly typed correctly. Or if the codebase uses Tailwind CSS, do not introduce new CSS classes or frameworks.
          - Be sure to take into account any changes that may impact other parts of the codebase, such as functions that call or depend on the modified code.
          - Provide strict, detailed string typing (if needed) and ensure consistency with the existing codebase.
          - Consider edge cases, error handling, and potential impact on existing functionality.
          - Break down complex changes into multiple, focused steps.
          - Double-check that all necessary files and changes are accounted for in the plan.
      
      Remember, your goal is to create a comprehensive, actionable plan that enables the efficient resolution of the GitHub issue. Your plan should be detailed enough for another developer to follow and implement successfully.`;

      ### Code Repository Information:
          - Files to Modify or Create: <files>${files}</files>

      ### GitHub Issue Details:
        - Issue: <github_issue>${githubIssue}</github_issue>
      
      ### Task:
          1. Understand the Problem:
              - Thoroughly review the GitHub issue inside the <github_issue> tags and identify the core problem to be solved.
              - Break down the issue into smaller, manageable tasks.
      
          2. Assess Available Information:
              - Analyze the provided codebase source map to understand the structure and relevant files.
              - Review the gathered research to identify any relevant code snippets, functions, or dependencies.
      
          3. Review Exit Criteria:
              - Analyze the exit criteria specified in the GitHub issue to understand the expected outcomes. If no exit criteria are provided, create measurable criteria for each file modification or creation.
              - Ensure that the changes made to the codebase align with the exit criteria. Each step of the plan should check off one or more exit criteria.
              - Ensure that no exit criteria are missed or overlooked during the planning process.
          
          4. Plan Code Changes:
              - Use the list of specific files within the  <files> tags that need to be modified or created to address the issue.
              - For each plan step, follow these guidelines:
                  - Specify the exact file path in the filePath tool output.
                  - Provide clear, detailed instructions on the changes to be made. You MUST use the research data and/or GitHub issue to inform your instructions. DO NOT make up instructions! If you do not have specific instructions you can be very general, but you MUST use the research data and/or GitHub issue to inform your instructions. NEVER make up specific instructions that are not based on the research data and/or GitHub issue.
                  - Include any necessary code snippets, imports, or function calls.
                  - Minimize the number of files that are modified per step.
              - Outline the order in which the changes should be made.
      
          5. Finalize the Plan:
              - Review the plan to ensure all necessary changes are accounted for.
              - Ensure that no files in the <files> tags are missed or incorrectly included.
              - Determine dependencies between files and use this information to specify the order of changes.
      
      ### Important:
          - Use the following tools to create your plan:
              - EditExistingCode: Modify one existing file in the codebase.
              - CreateNewCode: Create a new file in the codebase.
          - Each tool should be used with specific instructions and file paths.
          - You should have at least one function call per file in the <files> tag. You can have more if needed.
          - Ensure that the plan is clear, detailed, and follows the guidelines provided.
          - Create the shortest plan possible that addresses all necessary changes. Avoid unnecessary steps or complexity.
      
      Develop a comprehensive plan that outlines the necessary code changes to resolve the GitHub issue effectively. Your plan should be concise, specific, actionable, and easy for another developer to follow and implement.  
      Remember to leverage the provided file list, codebase information and research to make informed decisions and create a plan that effectively addresses the GitHub issue. Double-check your plan for completeness and clarity before submitting it.`;

  4. Create a brief, focused plan to resolve only the critical issues found.
  5. Ensure that your plan addresses dependencies between files and maintains code integrity.
  
  Guidelines:
  - Only include steps to fix critical issues. Minor stylistic or non-functional changes should be ignored.
  - It is critically important to include ALL fixes for a one file in a single step in your plan.
  - Provide context for each change, explaining why it's necessary.
  - If no critical issues are found, it's acceptable to state that no further changes are needed.
  - Only provide a plan if there are critical issues to address. Otherwise just say "No critical issues identified. No further changes are needed."
